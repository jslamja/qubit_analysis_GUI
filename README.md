# qubit_analysis_GUI
An interactive framework for analyzing qubit errors in quantum processors using the “Category-Based Error Budgeting” approach. It offers a graphical interface to process and classify calibration data and compute key metrics such as ( R_A ) (relative contribution rate) and ( D_A ) (disproportionality factor).
